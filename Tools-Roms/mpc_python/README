This small codebase replaces the `mpc` program historically included in `Tools-Roms` and written in Fortran.
It transforms input Fortran code, applying several rules such as line-folding and removing comments. Each
rule can be turned off as desired using CLI arguments.

For more help, run `mpc -h`

It currently aims to replicate the exact behaviour of the former `mpc` program. This can be tested using:

`pytest test_src.py`

which fetches and compiles the old mpc Fortran program, applies it and this python replacement to every .F
and .h file in `$ROMS_ROOT/src` and confirms that the outputs are identical.
