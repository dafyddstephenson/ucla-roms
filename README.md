# The Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS)
## Overview

Welcome to [C]Worthy's fork of UCLA ROMS. We maintain this fork in close collaboration with UCLA, prioritizing marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR) applications and open-source software practices.

  <i>A demonstration of mCDR-focused features: 6 weeks of transport of an alkalinity perturbation in a nested simulation with ROMS-MARBL, including upscaling at the interface between the two domains </i>

ROMS is a free-surface, terrain following, primitive equation ocean model, developed by our collaborators at UCLA. UCLA-ROMS is highly optimized, supports state-of-the-art biogeochemical modelling, and is well-suited for nested regional modelling from ocean basins down to estuaries.

## Installing and running

Detailed instructions on installing and running ROMS can be found in our [documentation](https://cworthy-ucla-roms.readthedocs.io).
